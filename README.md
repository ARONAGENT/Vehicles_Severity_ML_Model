# Vehicle Severity Prediction - Django & Machine Learning

## Overview
This is a Django-based Machine Learning project that predicts the severity of a vehicle accident based on various input factors such as speed, weather conditions, road type, and more. The model categorizes severity into **Minor, Major, or Fatal**.

## Features
- **User Input**: Takes accident-related inputs from users.
- **Prediction Model**: Uses a trained ML model to predict accident severity.
- **Django Integration**: The ML model is deployed within a Django web application.
- **REST API Support**: Allows API calls for predictions.

## Dataset & Inputs
The ML model is trained on accident data and considers the following factors:

1. **Speed** (in km/hr)
2. **Weather Condition**
   - 1 = Clear
   - 2 = Rainy
   - 3 = Fog
3. **Road Type**
   - 1 = Highway
   - 2 = City Road
   - 3 = Rural Road
4. **Time of Day**
   - 1 = Morning
   - 2 = Afternoon
   - 3 = Night
5. **Vehicle Type**
   - 1 = Car
   - 2 = Motorcycle
   - 3 = Truck
6. **Traffic Density**
   - 1 = Low
   - 2 = Medium
   - 3 = High

## Prediction Categories
- **Minor**: Low severity accidents
- **Major**: Moderate severity accidents
- **Fatal**: High severity accidents

## API Endpoints
The application provides REST API endpoints:

### 1. Predict Severity
**Endpoint:** `/predict/`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "speed": 80,
  "weather": 2,
  "road_type": 1,
  "time_of_day": 3,
  "vehicle_type": 1,
  "traffic_density": 3
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "severity": "Major"
}
```

## Conclusion
This project successfully integrates a Machine Learning model with Django to predict vehicle accident severity. It allows users to input accident conditions and receive a severity prediction instantly.
